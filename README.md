# JavaGame

This is a java game made with Swing Library. 

  - With the help of Swing timers, I repaint the game every 0.3 sec to update changes to the state of the game.
  - I have another timer called difficultyTimer, which functions to increment the speed of obstacles 
     (which helps to gradually increase the overall difficulty of this game)

  - This game accepts 5 keyboard inputs(Up key, Down key, Left key, Right key, and Space bar).
  - Each of the 5 obstacles(Tree, Bomb, Cloud, Mount, Log) in this game inherit from the Obstacles class because they share       position properties.
